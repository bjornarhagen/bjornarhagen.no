## ✨ Sauna Booking

Working on a side project with some friends:

### 👨‍💻 Hono and HTMX

Trying out these technologies; I'm very excited about HTMX. It's proving to be an efficient and low-complexity, yet powerful way to build web apps, using templating and server-side rendering instead of high-complexity JS components with mixed client/server rendering and hydration. Not to mention how much easier state management is on the server.

### 🐧 Linux

I've started exclusivly using Linux on my machines, specifically Pop!\_OS. It's better than ever before, especially with Steam's compatability tool for Windows programs and games.
