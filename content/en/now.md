Working on a couple of side projects with some friends:

### 👨‍💻 HTMX, Tailwind, and Laravel

I'm also working on a personal side project with these technologies; I'm very excited about HTMX. It's proving to be an efficient and low-complexity, yet powerful way to build web apps, using templating and server-side rendering instead of high-complexity JS components with mixed client/server rendering. Not to mention how much easier state management is on the server.
