# Principles

## Engineering

1. Embrace the chaos.
1. Don't abstract or optimize prematurely.
1. It's ok to have some duplicate code.
1. You probably don't need that ORM.
1. HATEOAS with HTML for web apps > JSON APIs
1. Clean code (https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) is not clean code (https://qntm.org/clean).

## Life

1. If you continue to wait for the right time, nothing will happen and you waste all your life
1. Just because everyone else is doing something, doesn't mean you should.
1. Exercise. It will improve all aspects of your life.
1. To grow, you must suffer.
1. Stay curious. Learning is a lifelong journey, not just something you do in school.
1. Be generous. Give and you shall receive.
1. Take breaks. You need rest to be productive.
1. Don't accept your own mediocrity.
1. Take risks. Don't be afraid to fail.
