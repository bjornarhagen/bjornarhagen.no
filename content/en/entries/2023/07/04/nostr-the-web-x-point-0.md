## Mastodon

In the wake of Twitter's contreversies sorrunding Elon Musk's take over, a lot of users starting looking for alternative platforms. One such platform is Mastodon. Personally I've given Mastodon a try a while back and I'm a big fan of the idea of a federated social network, but I think the way Mastodon solves it is not that great. There is a lot of UX issues due to the fact that as a user you tie yourself to one single instance.

For example if the instance you are on goes down, you might be out of luck, and if you want to change instance, you have to create a new account. If you want to follow someone on another instance, you have to create an account on that instance. If someone shares a link to an instance you haven't signed up for, you have to create a new account.

Now there are some solutions that help with this and allow some instance-to-instance communication and aggregation, but that only helps the spesific instances that use those solutions and doesn't solve the underlying issue.

## Bluesky

Bluesky is another platform that is also trying to create a decentralized social network. It's been in a private invite only beta for several years. This is in stark contrast to Nostr, which was open source and public from day 1.

## Nostr

Nostr is a protocol born out of the same idea of a decentralized social network, but they solved it a bit differently. I've tried it out recently and I have to say that it's a much better experience than Mastodon. While there are many technical differences, I think the main interesting practical difference is the fact that you have 1 single account that works on all instances.

That means if someone shares a link to some instance/client you don't normally use, you can still login there and like/follow etc. I think this vastly lowers the barrier to entry for new users and makes it much easier to use. Of course Nostr comes with it's own set of UX issues, but I think these can be solved by good client design. There is no underlying technical flaw in the same way as Mastodon.
