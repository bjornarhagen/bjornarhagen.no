I learnt HTML, CSS, JS and PHP through self study and got a few gigs through some close friends. Later on I
got my first real job as an apprentice at Optimale Systemer in Larvik. Around the same time I met my now wife,
we started the company Datahjelpen together so we could take on extra jobs outside of work and school.

After 2 years at Optimale Systemer I had learned a lot and considered myself a full-stack web developer,
though still very much a junior. I then moved to Halden to start my Bachelor of Science in Computer
Engineering at Ã˜stfold College University.

3 years later I got my degree and moved to Sandefjord. I started working full-time in Datahjelpen. After about
a year, Covid hit and I had to find a more stable job as no one was really willing to start new projects at
the time. That is how I ended up at Adstate, where I worked for 4 years. I'm currently working at [River Security](https://riversecurity.eu/). I still run Datahjelpen, though it's more
of a hobby as of right now.
