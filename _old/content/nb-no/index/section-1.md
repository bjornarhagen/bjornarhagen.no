Født og oppvokst i Larvik, Norge. Bor i Sandefjord med min fantastiske kone og vår søte hund.

I've always loved building and taking things apart, so when I at a young age was introduced to computers, it
didn't take very long before I was taking them apart and learning about how they worked. When I was 14 I saved
up scholarship money originally ment for school equipment to instead buy computer parts so I could build my
first desktop computer. Once I had built the computer I started learning about code and software. I was
instantly facinated with the web technologies and building websites. Since then I've learnt more and more
about programming and different software techologies.

When I'm not in front of the computer I love hiking, gaming and losing money on stocks and crypto :)
