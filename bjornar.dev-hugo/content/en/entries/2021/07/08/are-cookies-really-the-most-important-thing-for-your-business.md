## Priorities

The number one priority for so many businesses these days seem to be to get your _oh_ _so_ _precious_ consent in order track you with cookies, and don't you dare do **anything** on their website before you've given it!

I'm actually somewhat flabbergasted at what many websites have become, it seems businesses need to sit down and think about what the point of their website is.

Let's look at an example:

![Telenor cookie consent screen](/images/entries/2021/07/cookies/telenor.png)
Welcome to Telenor! We use cookies to track you!!! It's very very important for us that you allow us to track you, please.

> Ok great, no thanks Telenor. I'll just head over to Altibox instead

![Altibox mandatory cookie consent screen](/images/entries/2021/07/cookies/altibox.png)

> Ah ... maybe not after all.

Let's look at how it can (and should) be done, shall we?

> Can you believe it? Websites in EU with no cookie consent screen? How can this be?

## How can I make a website without cookie consent?

This part is pretty complex and technical, so bear with me here.
Here is an exhaustive list outlining how you can make your website without a cookie consent:

1. Don't spy on people

Ok, got it? I know it can be a lot to take in at once, so I recommend letting it all sink in for a while before reading it once more.

### No but really, how?

Really, just don't use tracking software.

In the case of Vodafone and 1&1, it seems they have some smart people who realized that they sell phones and mobile data subscriptions. They made this is their number one priority and de-prioritized spying on people.

It's actually possible to make a good product/service without spying on people. Just get your priorities straight.
