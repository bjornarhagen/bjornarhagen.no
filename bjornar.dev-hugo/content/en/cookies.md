### What does that mean?

No tracking of any kind. The website only use cookies for functionality.

### What kind of functionality?

Only for remembering your selection for dark/light mode, and only if you have selected it at all by clicking the button in the footer. Otherwise dark/light mode is based on the time of day.

### I want to delete my cookies.

{{< button-clear-cookies "Clear cookies" >}}

{{< script "/js/clear-cookies.js" >}}
