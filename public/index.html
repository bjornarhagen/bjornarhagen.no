          <p>Born and raised in Larvik, Norway. Currently living in Sandefjord with my lovely wife and our cute dog.</p>
          <p>
            I've always loved building and taking things apart, so when I at a young age was introduced to computers, it
            didn't take very long before I was taking them apart and learning about how they worked. When I was 14 I
            saved up scholarship money originally ment for school equipment to instead buy computer parts so I could
            build my first desktop computer. Once I had built the computer I started learning about code and software. I
            was instantly facinated with the web technologies and how reletivly easily you could build websites. Since
            then I've learnt more and more about programming and different software techologies.
          </p>
          <p>When I'm not in front of the computer I love hiking, gaming and losing money on stocks and crypto :)</p>

              I learnt HTML, CSS, JS and PHP through self study and got a few gigs through some close friends. Later on
              I got my first real job as an apprentice at Optimale Systemer AS in Larvik. Around the same time I met my
              now wife, we started the company Datahjelpen together so we could take on extra jobs outside of work and
              school.
            </p>
            <p>
              After 2 years at Optimale Systemer I had learned a lot and considered myself a full-stack web developer,
              though still very much a junior. I then moved to Halden to start my Bachelor of Science in Computer
              Engineering at Østfold College University.
            </p>
            <p>
              3 years later I got my degree and moved to Sandefjord. I started working full-time in Datahjelpen. After
              about a year Covid hit and I had to find a more stable job as no one was really willing to start new
              projects at the time. That is how I ended up at Adstate, where I currently work. I still run Datahjelpen,
              though it's more of a hobby as of right now.
