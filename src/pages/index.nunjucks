          <p>Born and raised in Larvik, Norway. Currently living in Sandefjord with my lovely wife and our cute dog.</p>
          <p>I've always loved building and taking things apart, so when I at a young age was introduced to computers, it didn't take very long before I was taking them apart and learning about how they worked. When I was 14 I saved up scholarship money originally ment for school equipment to instead buy computer parts so I could build my first desktop computer. Once I had built the computer I started learning about code and software. I was instantly facinated with the web technologies and building websites. Since then I've learnt more and more about programming and different software techologies.</p>
          <p>When I'm not in front of the computer I love hiking, gaming and losing money on stocks and crypto :)</p>

          <p>I learnt HTML, CSS, JS and PHP through self study and got a few gigs through some close friends. Later on I got my first real job as an apprentice at Optimale Systemer in Larvik. Around the same time I met my now wife, we started the company Datahjelpen together so we could take on extra jobs outside of work and school.</p>
          <p>After 2 years at Optimale Systemer I had learned a lot and considered myself a full-stack web developer, though still very much a junior. I then moved to Halden to start my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at √òstfold College University.</p>
          <p>3 years later I got my degree and moved to Sandefjord. I started working full-time in Datahjelpen. After about a year, Covid hit and I had to find a more stable job as no one was really willing to start new projects at the time. That is how I ended up at Adstate, where I currently work. I still run Datahjelpen, though it's more of a hobby as of right now.</p>
