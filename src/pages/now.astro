                        <p>
                            After 6 short months at River Security I have
                            started working for <a

                            > as their IT manager.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Leaving River Security so quickly was unexpected,
                            and while I'm very excited to join Gokstad and look
                            forward to to the amazing projects and I'll be
                            working on there, it's been kind of bittersweet to
                            leave. I had a great time at River, and will miss
                            the fantastic team there.

                            Gokstad Akademiet is a vocational school with a
                            focus on IT, design, sales, and marketing. I'm going
                            to help them scale their IT solutions to handle the
                            mind-blowing growth they've had, as well as work on
                            some exciting secret projects ;)

                            enjoying it. As a matter of fact, I just updated
                            this website to use Astro (used Hugo before).
