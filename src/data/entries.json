            "Clicking on a link going to an external site can be annoying if you aren't prepared for that. To improve the user experience you should show some kind of indicator for external links.\n\nOn this website I have made such an indicator. The following link is an example:\n<a href=\"//example.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Example link</a>.\n\nIf you are on desktop, when you hover the link it will show you an indicator. On mobile it should always show, although somewhat subtle to avoid beeing distracting.\n\nThe following code is how I implemented this indicator.\n\n**HTML:**\n\n```html\n<a href=\"//example.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Example link</a>\n```\n\n**CSS:**\n\n```css\na[target='_blank'] {\n  position: relative;\n}\n\na::after {\n  content: '\\\\2197';\n  position: absolute;\n  top: -0.5em;\n  right: -0.5em;\n  opacity: 0.5;\n}\n\n/* Desktop */\n@media (min-width: 60em) {\n  a::after {\n    opacity: 0;\n  }\n\n  a:focus::after,\n  a:hover::after {\n    opacity: 1;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOne drawback of my implementation is that it relies on `target=\"_blank\"`. Which you may not always want to add. So an alternative way to set this up would be to use some JavaScript that finds all external links and adds a CSS class to the elements.\n\nIf you are willing to put down the effort, an even better example can be seen on web.mit.edu/contact. If you hover over the \"Alumni Association\" link, it will show you the domain of the external site in a tooltip. Unfortunately they have no indicator for mobile users.\n\nThat's it! Really short and sweet tip on how to improve the UX of your external links.\n"

            "Reading code is easier when you have line numbers, but how can you show line numbers in a `<pre>` tag?\nThis can easily be solved with a few lines of JS and CSS, no need for a big external library.\n\n**JS:**\n\n```js\nfunction addLineNumbersToPres() {\n  const pres = document.querySelectorAll('pre')\n  pres.forEach((pre) => {\n    const lineNumberWrapper = document.createElement('span')\n    lineNumberWrapper.classList.add('pre-line-numbers')\n\n    const preLines = pre.textContent.split('\\\\n').length\n    for (let i = 0; i < preLines - 1; i++) {\n      const span = document.createElement('span')\n      span.appendChild(document.createTextNode(i))\n      lineNumberWrapper.appendChild(span)\n    }\n\n    pre.insertBefore(lineNumberWrapper, pre.firstChild)\n  })\n}\n```\n\nThis changes the HTML for the `<pre>` tag to look something like this:\n\n```html\n<pre>\n  <span class=\"pre-line-numbers\">\n    <span>0</span>\n    <span>1</span>\n    <span>2</span>\n    <span>3</span>\n    <span>4</span>\n    <span>5</span>\n  </span>\n  <code>\n    // Code comes here\n  </code>\n<pre>\n```\n\nNow for the styling.\n\n**CSS:**\n\n```css\npre {\n  position: relative;\n  width: 100%;\n  overflow: auto;\n  display: grid;\n  grid-template-columns: min-content max-content;\n}\n\npre .pre-line-numbers {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  height: 100%;\n  text-align: right;\n  user-select: none;\n}\n```\n\n**Extra:**\nAccording to caniuse.com user-select without prefixes is only supported by 50-70% of browsers at the time of writing, so here's the prefixed properties if you want to add them:\n\n```css\npre .pre-line-numbers {\n  -webkit-user-select: none;\n  -khtml-user-select: none;\n  -moz-user-select: none;\n  -ms-user-select: none;\n}\n```\n\n## What about syntax highlighting?\n\nSyntax highlighting is much more complicated to solve, but maybe I'll make a post about it one day. ~~For now my `<pre>` tags remain black and white.~~\n\n**Update:** I've added syntax highlighting to my page, it's setup via Hugo."

            "It goes without saying that the title is a bit of a hyperbole, but I do see a lot of developers using Docker in a bit of a strange way. There's a Dockerfile/Docker compose file present, but the developers never use it. They run everything 100% locally on the machine, the Dockerfile is just used in the CI/CD pipeline. I think this misses a large point of Docker, let's get into it.\n\n## Preqrequisites\n\nDocker or Podman.\n\n## Why use Docker?\n\nAn infamous phrase in software development you've probably heard before:\n\n> \"It works on my machine.\"\n\nWhile it's often used as a joke, this issue is probably more often a real one, stealing unnecessary time and causing headaches. Docker was supposed to solve this problem by making it work on your machine, then shipping your machine to the server/other developers, figuratively of course (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1755600973492564067\" target=\"_blank\">or maybe literally?</a>). However, if you don't use Docker locally, you're not shipping your guaranteed-to-work machine, you're still doing things the _\"old way\"_, but with extra complexity mixed in.\n\n## How to _properly_ use Docker\n\nThere are many ways to do this, but here's my preferred way:\n\n1. Create a folder in your project called `docker`.\n2. In this folder, create a `Dockerfile.local` and a `docker-compose.local.yml`.\n3. In the `Dockerfile.local`, include the main dependencies like Node:20 or Python:3.8.\n4. In the `docker-compose.yml`, include the services you need, like a database, a backend, and a frontend. Then crucially, include a `volumes` section to mount your code into the container.\n5. Now, when you want to run your app, you just run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d` in the `docker` folder, and you should have a running container.\n6. You can now connect to the container, and install your dependencies, run your tests, and start your app.\n\nWith this setup you no longer need to use tools like `nvm`, `pyenv`, `jenv`, etc. No more need to _pollute_ your machine with 5 versions of Node, 3 versions of Python, and 2 versions of Java. The only dependency you need is Docker. This has several benefits; you can easily switch between projects without having to worry about different versions of dependencies, you can easily onboard new developers, and you can easily run your app in CI/CD for more than just production builds.\n\n## Example setup\n\n/docker/Dockerfile.local:\n\n```Dockerfile\nFROM node:20-alpine\nWORKDIR /app\nEXPOSE 3000\nCMD [\"sh\"]\n```\n\nNotice how we don't copy over any files, we'll mount the code as a volume instead.\n\n/docker/docker-compose.local.yml:\n\n```yaml\nversion: '3.1'\n\nservices:\n  name-of-your-service:\n    build:\n      context: .\n      dockerfile: Dockerfile.local\n    ports:\n      - '3000:3000'\n    volumes:\n      - ../:/app # Mount the code into the container\n    tty: true\n```\n\nWith this `volume` setup, your whole project becomes available inside the container. Any change you do on your local machine is immediately reflected in the container.\n\n**Bonus:** If you're using VSCode, you can add a `.vscode/launch.json` file to easily launch your application without typing commands in the terminal. Only tested on Linux and MacOS, you might need to get Git Bash for Windows.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"configurations\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Docker - start container\",\n      \"command\": \"docker compose -f ${workspaceFolder}/docker/docker-compose.local.yml up -d\",\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\n      \"type\": \"node-terminal\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Docker - Connect to container\",\n      \"command\": \"docker exec -it $(docker ps | grep 'name-of-your-service' | awk '{print $1}') sh -c 'if [ -x /bin/bash ]; then exec /bin/bash; else exec /bin/sh; fi'\",\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\n      \"type\": \"node-terminal\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## End notes\n\nDocker is a very powerful tool, and hopefully this article has shown you how to use it more effectively for your local development environment.
